Welcome TO ARTH Computer Training Center</h1>
<p>

On the Insert tab,<span style="letter-spacing:10px;"> the galleries</span> include items that are 
designed to coordinate with the overall look of your 
document. You can use these galleries to insert tables, 
headers, footers, lists, cover pages, and other document
 building blocks. When you create pictures, charts, or diagrams, 
they also coordinate with your current document look.
